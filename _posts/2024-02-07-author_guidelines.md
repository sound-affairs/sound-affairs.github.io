# Sound Affairs Blog - Guidelines for authors


This short guide provides instructions as to how to prepare your blog post. All submissions will undergo a basic review and language edit before final publication. 

## Files
Please submit your document in a markdown format. 

## Formatting text
-	Italicize non-English words.
-	Follow U.S. spelling rules.
-	Insert a blank line when starting a new paragraph.
-	Add a few headings to improve readability on the web.
-	Place quotation marks after punctuation.

## Quotations
Keep quotations to a minimum. Include quotes within double inverted commas and use indented block quotations for longer extracts.

## Notes and References
-	Do not use footnotes; instead, employ in-text references according to the Author-Date system of The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition.
-	Include a bibliography at the end, following the same reference style.
-	When explicitly referring to an author for the first time, mention both first and last name. For all subsequent references, use only the surname.

## Illustrations
Include at least one but no more than three illustrations. Add short explanatory captions (author, date, source).
Please provide high-resolution reproductions of illustrations in either JPG or PNG format.

## Word count
Blog entries should number between 1,500 and 2,000 words, excluding the bibliography and illustration captions.

## Author Bio
Please include a brief biographical note (maximum 50 words) at the end of your essay.
