#### Abstract
__What Are Sound Studies?: A Brief Introduction to a Very Young and a Very Old Field of Research__ <br>
Sound Studies is a very young and diverse field of research with a long prehistory. Since at least
the 1970s, arBsts and scholars have been proposing ways to understand contemporary and
historical modes of listening, the emergence of new listening devices, and how communiBes
gather around sound experiences. This talk will provide a basic introducBon to the more recent
history of the field since 2004. It will also look at current developments in the 2020s to
decolonize sound studies and investigate aural diversity. Finally, the talk will focus on examples
of vernacular media culture that document how the cultural study of sound allows us to
interpret life and culture - in the present, in history, and in the future.
