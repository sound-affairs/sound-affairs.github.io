How do noise or silence affect the form and texture of interstate relations? Did new sound technologies alter the ways diplomats conducted business? Can we recreate the hissing, yelling, whispers of diplomatic conferences? Can we recover the voice of foreign envoys? How, in short, to think about the sounds of foreign relations? It is these questions that animate the research project _Sound Affairs: Sonic Histories of Foreign Relations, 1700-1990_.
