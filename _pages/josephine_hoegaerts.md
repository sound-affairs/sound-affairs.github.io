Iâ€™m Professor of European Culture after 1800. My research ranges widely and eccentrically from parliamentary politics to parrots, but (almost) always centres on vocal practices, and the effect they have on the world. I am currently finishing a book on the social history of speech and song in modern Western Europe. In the past, I have published on histories of gender, disability, and representation as well as on the methodological possibilities and challenges of including sounding voices in historical research.
