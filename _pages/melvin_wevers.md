# Melvin Wevers

Since 2020, I am an Assistant Professor in Digital History at the University of Amsterdam. My reserach focus on the application of computational methods to model historical processes. I do this by combining insights from the philosophy of history with the affordances of modeling techniques, such as time series analysis, bayesian statistics, deep/machine learning, and information theory.
