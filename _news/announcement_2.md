On Feb 1, 2024, Holden Carroll has joined our project as a Ph.D. candidate. He joins us from Cambridge, where he recently completed an MPhil in Politics and International Studies. The coming four years he will be working on a doctoral project that will explore the largely untapped UN radio archives. We are very happy that he has joined our team and looking forward to collaborating with him.
